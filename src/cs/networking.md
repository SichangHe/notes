# Networking

# encoding/decoding

- non-return to zero (NRZ)
    - baseline wander
    - synchronization problem
- non-return to zero inverted (NRZI): invert signal on 1
- Manchester encoding: xor clock and bit
    - only 50% efficiency
- 4b/5b encoding
    - 64b/66b
    - 128b/130b
- modulation

# framing

- sentinel-based framing
    - BISYNC, PPP
    - framing byte may appear in payload
        - escape byte
- count-based framing: body length before body
    - DDCMP
- bitwise sentinel framing
    - HDLC
    - bit stuffing: add extra 0 after 5 consecutive 1
- close-based framing
    - fixed size frame
    - need precise clock & synchronization phase
    - high efficiency

## error handling for framing

- parity bit: whether number of 1 is odd

    e.g. server RAM
    - fast, easy in hardware
    - miss many error
    - high overhead
- checksum: add up all sequence of certain length

    e.g. internet checksum
    - easy in software
    - miss many error
- cyclic redundancy check (CRC):
    divide message as a polynomial by generator polynomial

    e.g. BISYNC, DDCMP, HDLC, ethernet, Wi-Fi
    - easy in hardware with shift register
    - good implementation ensure catching
        - all single-bit error
        - double bit error
        - odd number of error
        - burst of error shorter than $k$ bit

# reliable transmission

- acknowledgement (ACK)
- timeout

## stop-and-wait transmission

if ACK arrive before timeout, send next frame, else, send same frame again

- timeout hard to choose
- need 1 bit for frame identifier and in ACK
- waste bandwidth

## continuous transmission: sliding window algorithm

sender

- send window size (SWS)
- last ACK received (LAR)
- last frame sent (LFS)

receiver

- receive window size (RWS)
- largest frame acceptable (LFA)
- last frame received (LFR)

### go-back-$n$

resend all frame since first lost frame

### duplicate ACK

- sender: resend on duplicate ACK
- receiver: resend ACK for the last in-order frame when frame out of order

### selective ACK

- sender: resend missing frame between last ACK and SACK
- receiver: send SACK for out-of-order frame

### sliding window performance

utilize bandwidth

frame size $f$,\
bandwidth $b$,\
transmission time $t$,\
round trip time $r$,\
time to first ACK $t_0$,\
number of packet $n$

$$
t=\frac{f}{b}\\[6pt]
t_0=t+r\\[6pt]
n=\left\lceil \frac{t_0}{t} \right\rceil
$$

### sliding window frame identifier count

- smaller is better since overhead
- â‰¥ SWS + RWS: prevent overlap of sequence

# Ethernet

- carrier sense: idle/busy
- multiple access: share medium and broadcast
- collision detection

## Ethernet switch

- usually point-to-point
- high collision

## Ethernet address

48 bit printed in hex separated per byte by colon

- unique
- manufacturer are allocated 3-byte OUI
- broadcast address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

# Wi-Fi

- carrier sense
- multiple access
- collision avoidance
    - request to send (RTS): inform future send
    - clear to send (CTS): reserve medium

## Wi-Fi distribution system

- access point connected to Ethernet
- automatic handover
    - support client mobility
    - new access point inform old one

# network switch

interconnect link of the same type

- many port
- can connect to each other
